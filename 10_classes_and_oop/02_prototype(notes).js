// Prototype..... in console window we are writing code.

const newHero = ["hulk", "spiderman"]  // undefined
newHero 
/* Output
(2)Â ['hulk', 'spiderman']
0: "hulk"
1: "spiderman"
length: 2
[[Prototype]]: Array(0)
*/

// about this prototype we will learn..

/* NOTE:-
  javascript default behaviour is prototypial (means you are finding something 
  and you are not getting so it check all above layers until it is not get null value)
  so we call this prototypial inheritance.

 by this behaviour our 'this' keyword, new keyword etc we get.
