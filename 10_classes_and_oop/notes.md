# javascript and classes

- Do javascript really have classes ?

- -> Javascript is a prototype- based language. nor oop.

- -> Its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype- based inheritance mechanisms.

- -> In another words it provide a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class- based language such as  java or C++.

- -> behind the scene all thing happen in prototype only.

- so purely javascript does not have classes.
